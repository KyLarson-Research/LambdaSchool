        DOM
        DOM element selectors
        DOM events

DOM -
Document Object Model is the relationship between the front end and high level backend of a webpage. Everytime a browser loads a webpage, it converts the html into a model which interfaces with javascript for adding and removing elements, changine attributes of elements and changing styling of the elements.

DOM element selectors - 
Dogument objects such as tag-delimited 'divs' or other html may be selected using a selector. An example of a selector is the .getElementsByClassName function which takes the class as arguments (Example 'divCLass'), and .getElementByID function which takes the Id of the specific html tag. 

DOM events - 
When the user interracts with a webpage an event may be triggered. The event may be used to activate functions through the use of 'listeners' on of which may be instantiated through .addEventListener function.
