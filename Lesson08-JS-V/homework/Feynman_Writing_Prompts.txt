Instructions
Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

prototype
Constructors

Prototype - 
A prototype is a method that all objects of a particular class have access to. In the computer science world this is a form function level inheritance. 

Constructors -
Instead of defining an object from sctatch it can be instantiated from an existing object using a keyword, "new" by default. 
Additionally, a constructor can be overloaded within the original (parent) object: (for example)

class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
