Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables
Strings
Functions (arguments, return)
if statements
Boolean values (true, false)

Context for a 12-year-old:
On the most basic level computer's are sophisticated calculators. Javascript is a language carrying computation instructions. 
Computers take inputs as numbers as from the user, perform mathematical operations and produce outputs according to instructions.

Variables - 
A variable is one form of input informataion is used to represent any of a set of data or datatypes,
where at the high language level of javascript are typically Strings, Numbers, and Booleans.

Strings - 
A string as a javascript datatype is a block of text which often excludes whitespace characters space ' ', new line '
' and tab '	'. 
This file you are reading can be opened and read as a serries of strings or one long string. 
In javascript, unlike many other languages, strings are differentiated from other code by single quotation marks. 

Functions -
A function is an operation taking any set of input(s) and producing one output. 
In javascript, functions describe the process wherby input variables are turned into output data.  

Arguments -
In javascript, unlike languages such as C/C++ or assembly, functions take inputs
referred to as arguments. Arguments go within the parenthases.

Return - 
In javascript, the only way information makes it back out of the function -other than to directly print via console.log()-
is to return the data once the operations of the function had been performed. 

If Statements -
In javascript, operations can be limited by If Statements. If Statements perform one operation if the boolean value condition within the parenthases is true
and perform another operation if the condition within the parenthatses is false. 

Boolean Value -
In javascript, a boolean value takes one of two possible values, true or false. A boolean is a variable type and is often produced by comparison operators <,<=, >,>=,===,and!===
