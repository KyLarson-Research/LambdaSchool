Objective: Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Objects
Properties
Methods
for in loop
Dot notation vs bracket notation

Objects -
An object is a multivalue variable consisting of pairs of "keys" and "values," and can contain functions.
An Example is:
const landlord = {
	name: 'kyle.c.larson';
	garagecode: 666;
	racecardriver: false;
	nothappywithtennantsthatdontpay function(){
		console.log( 'Message from' + this.name + ', your rent is overdue and is acruing $35 every day late.' );
	},
	
};

Properties - 
The key:value pair of an Oject is refered to a poperty. Properties may be removed using the delete keyword, but this is uncommon and frowned upon in some circles.

Methods -
A function within an object is called a method.

for in loop -
One may iterate through the properties in a variable or object using a special word which in the case of objects is key.

An Example is: 
for (let key in landlord){
	console.log(key);
	console.log(landlord[key]);
{

// name
// 'kyle.c.larson'
// garagecode
// 666
// racecardriver
// false


Dot notation vs bracket notation
Object keys and methods may be accessed using dot notation: landlord.name; //kyle.c.larson
Object keys and methods may also be accessed using bracket notation: landlord['name']; //kyle.c.larson
